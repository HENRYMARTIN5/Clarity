# Clarity
Clarity ~ The Modern, Moddable Platformer!


### Building Clarity to an Executable

Run `npm install`, then run `npm run build`.

### Hosting Clarity

Fork the repo, then change all the url fields in the code (use vscode and find all instaces of `henrymartin5.github.io`) to your own new url. If you want the same workshop to be present, don't change the Clarity workshop URL. Otherwise, fork the repl.it repl (https://replit.com/@N3rdL0rd/clarityWorkshop) and change those urls to your own workshop.
